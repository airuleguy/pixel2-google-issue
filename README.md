 *Ritz1:39 p. m.*
Thanks for contacting Google Support. My name is Ritz.

*Alejandro Iruleguy1:39 p. m.*
Hi Ritz, how is it going?

*Alejandro Iruleguy1:39 p. m.*
Again, apologies for bothering you so early in the morning.

*Ritz1:40 p. m.*
Hi Alejandro! You've reached Shipping and Refunds team.* How are you doing today?

*Alejandro Iruleguy1:40 p. m.*
Pretty good, although a bit tired of hopping from one side to another trying to solve this issue.

*Ritz1:42 p. m.*
Oh Sorry to hear that.

*Alejandro Iruleguy1:43 p. m.*
It's allright. Finally I could get in touch with you guys, so hopefully it was all worth it.

*Ritz1:43 p. m.*
I willdo the best that I can for you.

*Alejandro Iruleguy1:44 p. m.*
More than enough, thank you.

*Ritz1:44 p. m.*
Is this for the Pixel 2 phone?

*Alejandro Iruleguy1:44 p. m.*
Yes. Do you want me to sum things up for your better understanding?

*Ritz1:48 p. m.*
Sorry to keep you waiting.

*Alejandro Iruleguy1:49 p. m.*
Not a problem

*Ritz1:52 p. m.*
It says here you didn't receive the package due to delay in estimated delivery dates

*Alejandro Iruleguy1:54 p. m.*
Exactly. Moreover, I paid a little bit extra to have it shipped with priority, just in case something like this happened, but google support has ben unresponsive until today.

*Ritz1:56 p. m.*
I see. That sound a little rough though. I'd be more than happy to check options here for you.

*Ritz1:57 p. m.*
Is this for the order number GS.9197-5619-7270?

*Alejandro Iruleguy1:58 p. m.*
That's correct.

*Alejandro Iruleguy1:59 p. m.*
Apologies, I did not mean any offense. Up until today I was met with default answers and a lot of stalling, that's the main reason I'm disappointed with the support provided. This chat is getting somewhere at least.

*Ritz1:59 p. m.*
I'd really hope so.

*Ritz2:01 p. m.*
I have checked up until now. Status is still with our shipping partners and no tracking number yet.

*Ritz2:01 p. m.*
I apologize for the delay on this order.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:02 p. m.*
Not on you, mate. What can be done about it?

*Ritz2:02 p. m.*
If you'd like, I'd be happy to be your personal tracker for this order and will send you follow-up email once I have seen any movements in our system here.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:02 p. m.*
Problem is I have a deadline. If the phone does not arrive on the 10th at the very latest, I will need to cancel the order, as it will be missing the flight over.

*Ritz2:03 p. m.*
Oh that's the thing.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:03 p. m.*
Mhmm.*

*Ritz2:03 p. m.*
Is your flight after the 10th?

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:03 p. m.*
It's on the 12th.

*Ritz2:03 p. m.*
I see.

*Ritz2:04 p. m.*
I'd really hope so that this order will be delivered before that time.

*Ritz2:05 p. m.*
On the other hand, currently, Google is working on this issue and is doing our best to delivered orders as soon as possible.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:06 p. m.*
Sigh.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:07 p. m.*
Okay, a couple alternatives I can think of:
1) Is changing the color of the phone chosen going to affect delivery dates? I don't care which one it is, really.
2) Is there a distribution center that we could pick the phone up and at least skip some of the delay?

*Ritz2:09 p. m.*
Upon checking here, your order is already with our shipping partners. The only missing information that we need to wait is really the tracking number. Therefore, we cannot change the color anymore. Second, I'm afraid to say that Google doesn't have any distribution center for pick-up.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:11 p. m.*
Okay. Up until when can I wait to cancel the order? I definitely do not want the phone delivered after the plane is off, but perhaps there is still a little more time until the tracking number is issued.

*Ritz2:12 p. m.*
For canceling orders, for as long as you can see the cancel button on the Order History.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:12 p. m.*
I do not see it already.

*Ritz2:12 p. m.*
Well, I'm afraid to say you can no longer cancel it.

*Ritz2:13 p. m.*
But, It's okay no matter what happen. We will still hope it gets delivered before your flight.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:13 p. m.*
Inadmissible. I was not responsible for the delay in shipping dates, how come I have to pay the price?

*Ritz2:14 p. m.*
I understand, to be honest they are already working hand on hand on these orders. Apparently, your order has been impacted by the delays of shipment.

*Ritz2:14 p. m.*
We will definitely can look for another options here.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:15 p. m.*
That does not help, Ritz. I do not want to pay for a phone that will miss me until God knows when, because Google had an internal issue with a shipping partner. That is not really on me.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:16 p. m.*
I would like to cancel the order now, just to be sure.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:16 p. m.*
How can you help me do that?

*Ritz2:16 p. m.*
Sorry to hear that.

*Ritz2:16 p. m.*
I have tried to but it's no longer cancelable.

*Ritz2:17 p. m.*
Is there somebody from the address you have provided us can refuse the package if it will still be delivered.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:18 p. m.*
There will be nobody home.

*Ritz2:18 p. m.*
You can get back on me to proceed if ever to help you further.

*Ritz2:19 p. m.*
Okay, I believe this would be much better. If ever you really needed to leave. Please leave some notes at the front door to have the delivery man return the device back to us.

*Ritz2:19 p. m.*
If ever the tracking is available and you needed to leave already and cannot wait for the package. I can request the shipper no one will receive the package.

*Ritz2:20 p. m.*
For now, we cannot do anything else because there is no tracking number yet.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:20 p. m.*
Please, put me in touch with somebody that can help. I think we both agree this is not how things should work; this is a special situation that is harming a customer due to an internal problem with this shipping partner.

*Ritz2:20 p. m.*
Like what I said, I'd be happy to get in touch with you from time to time so I can personally assist you no matter what happened with the package.

*Ritz2:21 p. m.*
I am not hoping it will not be delivered. I am really praying it will still be delivered to you at least before you leave your house for your flight.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:23 p. m.*
Praying does not longer do it for me, Ritz. I need to talk to somebody that can help, otherwise I will have to go through the hassle of legal action. Who could be able to help me?

*Ritz2:24 p. m.*
I will do my best. Since you've reached the escalation team already from Shipping and Refunds.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:25 p. m.*
I seriously cannot believe this is the first time you encounter a case like this. There has to be someone with enough authority to issue a refund at this point.

*Ritz2:28 p. m.*
Upon checking here your order is above $1000 and for this order it requires signature. If no one would sign for this order, it will automatically return to our warehouse.

*Ritz2:30 p. m.*
In this case, we may communicate via email that I have sent you.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:32 p. m.*
No, that won't do. Google is already at fault here, taking my money and not delivering within the allotted time frame. I am willing to extend the period up to the 10th, but if the package cannot make it in time, I would have a refund issued.

*Ritz2:35 p. m.*
I understand your point. By the way, please be informed I won't be available on Saturday and Sunday. I'll be back Monday.

*Ritz2:36 p. m.*
Please do send me email if you have received any updates.

*Ritz2:36 p. m.*
On the other hand, our shipping partners will still send another emails to you with the shipping details.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:36 p. m.*
Are you unable to escalate the issue further?

*Ritz2:37 p. m.*
As of the moment, this issue has been raised already.

*Ritz2:38 p. m.*
And we handle these cases, that's why follow-up via email is the option that I am providing you so you can communicate with me directly.

*Ritz2:38 p. m.*
I'd personally handle this case for you.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:40 p. m.*
But none of the options you provide are real answers, Ritz. Please put yourself in my situation, if you were being asked to go on a 3 months trip without your phone and no option to get a refund so you can purchase it somewhere else

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:40 p. m.*
what kind of service is that?

*Ritz2:41 p. m.*
I understand your situation.

*Ritz2:41 p. m.*
As much as I wanted to give you refund, The order as of the moment was not charged yet. It is still an authorization hold on your account.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:42 p. m.*
How can I refuse this authorization request?

*Ritz2:42 p. m.*
We really do not have option for that our shipping partners is already working on it.

*Ritz2:44 p. m.*
As of the moment, we have also raised this to them to make it faster.

*Ritz2:44 p. m.*
As of now, I really don't have options yet.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:45 p. m.*
Don't you have a similar phone available at your warehouse to be dispatched ASAP

*Ritz2:45 p. m.*
But to really wait. I will make sure to further assist you right after we get response from them,

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:47 p. m.*
Don't you have a similar phone available at your warehouse to be dispatched ASAP instead?

*Ritz2:51 p. m.*
All available items can only be found at the Google Store.

*Ritz2:52 p. m.*
I really wanted to keep you on chat. But I do not want to waste to much of your time here. That's why I offer to take care of this case from here.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:53 p. m.*
Yes, but you will not be able to help me. As you said, you will be unavailable during the weekend and by Monday it will be already too late.

*Ritz2:54 p. m.*
You may get back on us by tomorrow. I will leave notes on this case from here. So one of our team can be able to check status of the order.

*Ritz2:54 p. m.*
You may use this Case Id number as the reference 2-2213000020409.

*Ritz2:54 p. m.*
I will still keep the case so I can follow-up with you when I get back.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:54 p. m.*
Will there be anyone available during the weekend?

*Ritz2:55 p. m.*
Yes there will be definitely.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:55 p. m.*
Then forward the case to somebody, I will pick it up from there.

*Ritz2:55 p. m.*
We are 24/7 here with Shipping and Refunds team.*

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:56 p. m.*
I cannot believe you're unable to find somebody with enough leverage to fix this mess.

*Ritz2:56 p. m.*
I will have my co-lleague help check this order for me.

*Ritz2:57 p. m.*
I will assign somebody on my behalf. Do not worry. She will get back with you tomorrow.

*Ritz2:57 p. m.*
Is that Okay?

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:57 p. m.*
No, I want to keep talking to somebody until the issue is resolved.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:57 p. m.*
Please get me your team lead or whomever may be able to know who can help me.

*Ritz2:58 p. m.*
Unfortunately, we cannot tallk for the whole day. I'm afraid to say that.

*Alejandro Iruleguy2:58 p. m.*
Then help me fix this fast.

*Ritz2:58 p. m.*
But we will make sure to follow-up with once we have some updates.

*Ritz2:59 p. m.*
As for now, what we really just need to do is to wait for the tracking number.

*Ritz2:59 p. m.*
and updates coming from our shipping partners.

*Ritz3:00 p. m.*
I have already forwarded this case to my colleague and she will email you tomorrow for the status.

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:00 p. m.*
And when the tracking number arrives and the delivery date marked for later than the 10th, what will you do? Say you're sorry?

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:00 p. m.*
I need to have this escalated further, if you are unable to keep helping me.

*Ritz3:03 p. m.*
As I have mentioned we are from escalation team already.

*Ritz3:04 p. m.*
As of the moment, there's really nothing I can do but to really wait.

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:05 p. m.*
Don't tell me there is no escalation team above yours, or that I somehow found a loophole in Google's coverage, because that seems fairly unlikey.

*Ritz3:05 p. m.*
You may also call us to further check status of the order to make it faster. They can be able to see my notes from there.

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:06 p. m.*
I cannot call a toll-free number on Australia, as I am not in the country.

*Ritz3:07 p. m.*
This issue to be honest has been raised directly to higher support than me. And that is why we were advised to still wait for the delivery status. Your order unfortunately was included to those orders that has been impacted by the delay.

*Ritz3:07 p. m.*
That is why we apologize for the delay.

*Ritz3:08 p. m.*
Our higher support is already aware on these delays that's why we were advised by them to inform you guys to still wait and will definitely make sure look for other options on case to case basis.

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:09 p. m.*
Then please ask somebody in that higher support line if I can get in touch with them directly, at least via email.

*Ritz3:10 p. m.*
I know your situation requires immediate results since you needed to have the phone with you on hand. But I cannot stay longer to wait for the status.

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:10 p. m.*
Then forward me to some of this higher level support so that I can talk to them directly.

*Ritz3:11 p. m.*
I will have one of our specialist here with shipping to further give you follow-up once very while. I am sorry that I cannot stay longer on the line so I can also assist other customers. I will make sure to have this case endorsed properly with one of my shipping specialist team.*

*Ritz3:11 p. m.*
If I am not available, they will definitely send you a follow-up.

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:13 p. m.*
That does not cut it. I am starting a chargeback request with the issuer bank and will take legal action against Google for this ridiculous situation.

*Ritz3:13 p. m.*
I understand and respect your decision for that.

*Ritz3:14 p. m.*
We are just going around the circle and I do not want to waste too much of your time.

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:16 p. m.*
Agreed. You could break the circle and put me in touch with somebody that can do something. I have no time to wait for this internal issue to be resolved, as the phone will miss me.

*Ritz3:18 p. m.*
I'm afraid to say we are the highest team already and I cannot further ask somebody higher than me to speak with you directly. I hope you understand.

*Ritz3:20 p. m.*
You've been pretty quiet. Are you still there?

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:21 p. m.*
Yes

*Ritz3:21 p. m.*
I really wanted to stay on the line with you. But I can only provide information that I am seeing here.

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:22 p. m.*
You just told me that there is a higher level support team

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:22 p. m.*
it is not too much to ask for help from them, I suppose.

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:22 p. m.*
given the circumstances

*Ritz3:22 p. m.*
They are already helping us and as much as I wanted to transfer you they do not have way to do so.

*Ritz3:23 p. m.*
We are already the highest team here from escalations.

*Alejandro Iruleguy3:23 p. m.*
An internal email to which to write?

*Ritz3:23 p. m.*
We are bounded to follow all instructions form the higher tier of support.

*Ritz3:23 p. m.*
We are also the email escalation team.*

*Ritz3:24 p. m.*
I have this case already endorsed and my colleague will help us in checking status.

*Ritz3:24 p. m.*
I hope you do understand.

*Ritz3:26 p. m.*
You've been pretty quiet. Are you still there?

*Ritz3:26 p. m.*
It looks like you may have left the chat. In order to assist other waiting customers, I'll have to end our session if I don't receive a reply from you. No worries - you can always start a new chat with us when you return.

*Ritz3:26 p. m.*
Thank you for contacting Google Play chat support. Your chat session is now complete.
